## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

### Removed support for Python 3.8

Python 3.8 is no longer supported as of this release; please upgrade to Python 3.9 or above before upgrading Wagtail.

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customisations

### Deprecation of `PageListingButton` support inside dropdown buttons

Using the `wagtail.admin.widgets.PageListingButton` class in the `register_page_listing_more_buttons` or `register_page_header_buttons` hooks is now deprecated. Instead, use the `PageButton` or `Button` class to render buttons in the dropdown menu. When the support is removed in a future release, the button may not be rendered correctly.

This only affects the usage of `PageListingButton` inside dropdown buttons. Usage of the `PageListingButton` class for the top-level `register_page_listing_buttons` hook is still supported.
